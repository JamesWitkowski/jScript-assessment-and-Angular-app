/**
 * In this scenario you will be working with a single data set.
 * The Data set is an array of objects.
 * Each object is a film that has a name and year of release. 
 * 
 * Many of the questions will require you to finish the functions that are prewritten,
 * Add arguments when needed
 * You will not need to invoke any of the functions yourself
 * The Unit Tests should let you know when you got the function right
 * 
 * For Question 7 you will need to move everything over to VSCode and build your angular app there.
 * When you complete the app push it to your github and slack me with the url.

//Question 1 - Finish the function called filmCount so it will return the total number of films in the array
function filmCount(){
    var count = 0;
  for(var i = 0; i < films.length; i++){
    count++;
  }
  return count;
}

//Question 2 - Find film by Title 
function findTitle(name){
    var out = {};
    for (var i = 0; i < films.length; i++){
      
        if(name === films[i].name){
            out = films[i];
        }
    }
    return out;
}

//Question 3 - Add each of the movies in the newFilms array to the films array
var newFilms = [{
  name: 'Tangled',
  year: 2010
},{
  name: 'Aladdin',
  year: 1992
},{
  name: 'Zootopia',
  year: 2016
},{
  name: 'The Little Mermaid',
  year: 1989
},{
  name: 'Beauty and the Beast',
  year: 1991
}];

var films = films.concat(newFilms);

//Question 4 - Remove any duplicate titles found in the films array by name
function removeDups(array){
     
}

//Question 5 - Find All films within a starting year and ending year
function findReleasesWithin(start, end){
  
}

//BONUS QUESTION - Arrange the films array from oldest to newest 
function sortByYear(){
 
}

//Question 7 - Using the films array build an angular app
//that will let you manage adding and removing films with a view
